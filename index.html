    <h1><stong>The Two Bucket System</strong></h1>

    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>I do not believe that our model of the mystery black box is a possibility as to what is in the real mystery black box, this is because of out 2-tube system. I believe that it could not be in the mystery black box because it guarenteed at least a portion of the water to come out of the spout every trial, unlike in the real mystery black box where there was a trial in which no water came out of the spout after 500 mL of water was poured in.

    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box is a black box that is always sealed, the box pours water out of a spout at the bottom with a funnel at the top for pouring liquid in. The amount of water that comes out of the black box seems to have no relation to the amount of water poured into the box. When first investigating the mystery black box we saw that the amount of water coming out varied in every test, never being the same amount of water coming out then was put in. With the accpetion of trial #11 where 500 mL of water was poured into the mystery black box and 500 mL of water came out. Our approach to figuring out how the mystery black box works was thinking about what would not work, things like direct tubes leading from the funnel at the top straight to the spout at the bottom. Our second model of the mystery black box had a set of tubing, one leading directly to the spout and another that poured some of the water into a small container. The water that was poured into the small container sat in the container until nough water filled the container that it reached a small hole near the bottom of the container. Connected to the small hole was another tube leading to the spout. To test our model we poured different amount of water into the funnel at the top and measured how much water came out of the spout during each trial. Overall we had varying results in every trial, one place where this was extremely prominent was triasl #4 and #5. In #4 300 mL of water were poured into our model of the mystery black box and 60 mL of water came out of the box. In #5 300 mL of water were poured in again and 420 mL of water came out.</p>

    <h2>Reasoning 1</h2>
    <p>Models are an individual’s version of something that exists either conceptually or in real life. A model can be a smaller or larger version of something or it can be a variation of something. Models can be useful because they help us test concepts and ideas to see what works and doesn’t work. Usually models are meant to repliacte something else, as it is a representation, but often times models are less complex to test big ideas. Models can sometimes be flawed because they are sometimes adjusted to test and allow different things to happen.</p>

    <h2>Reasoning 2</h2>
    <p>The claim made should be believed because a main component to the model of the mystery black box is the main tube leading directly from the funnel to the spout. In the real mystery black box in one trial there was an input of 500 mL and an output of 0 mL, if there was a tube leading directly from the input funnel to the output spout then it’d be impossible for 0 mL of water to come out.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Reasoning 3</h2>
    <p>I belive that there is a three tube system, none of which lead directly to the output spout, but each leading to a different collection bucket which then lead to the spout. If this was true then there would be the possibility of no water coming out in some trials. No the outcome predicted by this claim were not observed, this further proves my idea that there is no tube leading directly from the input funnel to the output spout.</p>
