    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I do not believe that our model of the mystery black box is a possibility as to what is in the real mystery black box, this is because of out 2-tube system. I believe that it could not be in the mystery black box because it guarenteed at least a portion of the water to come out of the spout every trial, unlike in the real mystery black box where there was a trial in which no water came out of the spout after 500 mL of water was poured in.

    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a black box that is always sealed, the box pours water out of a spout at the bottom with a funnel at the top for pouring liquid in. The amount of water that comes out of the black box seems to have no relation to the amount of water poured into the box. When first investigating the mystery black box we saw that the amount of water coming out varied in every test, never being the same amount of water coming out then was put in. With the accpetion of trial #11 where 500 mL of water was poured into the mystery black box and 500 mL of water came out. Our approach to figuring out how the mystery black box works was thinking about what would not work, things like direct tubes leading from the funnel at the top straight to the spout at the bottom. Our second model of the mystery black box had a set of tubing, one leading directly to the spout and another that poured some of the water into a small container. The water that was poured into the small container sat in the container until nough water filled the container that it reached a small hole near the bottom of the container. Connected to the small hole was another tube leading to the spout. To test our model we poured different amount of water into the funnel at the top and measured how much water came out of the spout during each trial. Overall we had varying results in every trial, one place where this was extremely prominent was triasl #4 and #5. In #4 300 mL of water were poured into our model of the mystery black box and 60 mL of water came out of the box. In #5 300 mL of water were poured in again and 420 mL of water came out.</p>
