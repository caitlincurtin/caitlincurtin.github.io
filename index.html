    <p>I do not believe that our model of the mystery black box is a possibility as to what is in the real mystery black box, this is because of out 2-tube system. I believe that it could not be in the mystery black box because it guarenteed at least a portion of the water to come out of the spout every trial, unlike in the real mystery black box where there was a trial in which no water came out of the spout after 500 mL of water was poured in.
